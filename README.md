Flutter Plant App 🌱
Overview
Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my Green Plant Care App project, designed to help plant lovers (like me) easily manage their plant collection! 🌿 
This app lets you explore different plant species, get care tips, and even track the plants you have at home. 
The coolest part? You can create an account to personalize your plant journey.

This app is built using Flutter (so it runs on both iOS and Android 📱), making plant care easier for users no matter what device they’re using!

🌟 Features
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Runs on both Android and iOS, with responsive design for various screen sizes.
Plant Database: Browse through plants and get detailed care instructions for each one.
Plant Tracking: Save your favorite plants and keep track of their care.
User Authentication: Secure login via Firebase Authentication (sign in with email or third-party providers).
State Management: Uses the Provider package to manage app state efficiently.
